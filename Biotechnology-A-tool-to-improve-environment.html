        <h2 style="font-family: quicksand "> Introduction </h2>
        <p style="font-family: quicksand ; font-size: large;">
            Nowadays, as we can see our environment faces considerable pressure like forecast increase in the world population to more than 8.5 billion, limitation of available land and water resources, slow increase in crop yields, demand for cheaper and safer food and the need to sustain and improve the surrounding environment.<br><br> 
             The major sources of environmental pollution are industries, agricultural and other anthropogenic and biogenic sources etc. 
        </p><br><br>

        <h2 style="font-family: quicksand "> Role of Biotechnology : </h2>
    <p style="font-family: quicksand ; font-size: large;">
        The role of biotechnology for improvement in environment is well documented. <br><br>

        Today, biotechnology is being considered as a emerging technology for improve environment or we can say, it can also help in environmental protection. <br><br>
  
   With the help of biotechnology, we can control environmental pollution through biodegradation, bio- transformation, bio- accumulation of toxic compounds like organics, metals oil and detergents etc. Through biotechnology production of non- conventional, non- polluting energy sources like biodiesel methanol, bio- ethanol, biogas, bio- hydrogen etc. <br> <br>
   Instead of using chemical- pesticides or fertilizers, we can use bio- fertilizers and bio- pesticides with the help of biotechnology. Biotechnology also includes tool like Biosensor, which is used for monitoring pollution and the recovery of resources from toxic or non- toxic wastes through biotechnological approach. Biotechnology is also a pivotal tool for sustainable develop, which has become a priority for the worldâ€™s policy makers. <br> <br>

      So, Biotechnology has a played an important role towards environmental pollution abatement by using environment friendly techniques and products. Overall goal of biotechnology is to attain safe and sustainable environment.
